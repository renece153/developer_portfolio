# Rey's Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! 

## Introduction

This portofolio is to show case my versitility in programming, system design thinking and solution implementation.

---
## 📓 Major Projects

Major Projects are complex system integrations that requires at least two different systems interacting. Usually, it takes 6 months to develop, test and set up.

### 🗃️ Asset Management System for Database Management Systems
- **Summary:** Modify and retrofit inventory management systems to function with relational database systems through a web interface designed for operation on a Windows server (deployed via AWS). The programming languages involved include SQL, Python, JavaScript, PHP, CSS, and HTML. Regrettably, the system was deactivated due to accumulating expenses. However, all documentation remains accessible below.

- **Skills:** _SQL, Python, JavaScript, PHP, HTML/CSS, AWS, Cloud, Modular, OOP, Web Development_

📓 [Full Teachnical Documentation](https://zenodo.org/records/8176445)

Technical Documentation is available at Zenodo as its my master's thesis.
